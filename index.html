Rogue-Like, But Make It Pokémon
In PokeRogue, you dont just walk around tall grass hoping for a cool catch — youre charging into randomly generated zones, battling wave after wave of enemies! The game changes every time, with new paths, new trainers, and wild surprises waiting at every turn.

Classic Battles with a Twist
The battles might feel familiar, but the stakes are much higher. Each run pushes your team to their limits. Youll face relentless waves, challenging bosses, and your choices will shape the entire run. One wrong move and its back to the start — but dont worry, youll come back stronger!

Grow Stronger with Every Run
